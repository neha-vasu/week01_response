		<h3>Response to "Ways of Seeing"</h3>
		<p>Before watching this I knew that I had an inherent bias when viewing art due to my own personal experiences. I knew that it was the same for others as well. There are so many factors that go into my bias and the way I interpret things, however, what I did not think of was the idea that school and society has indoctrinated us with the idea that "art is beautiful" or false mystification of art. As long as I remember, I have thought of art as beautiful. I also found the way we view gender as interesting. Near the end of the video, there was a painting by Caravaggio shown to children who interpreted them directly. They tried to immediately understand what was going on in the painting. I wonder if the false mystification I hold has significantly impacted the way I interpret paintings. When I visited the Met a few years ago, I just thought the old paintings were beautiful and did not try to think of what was happening in the picture or connect it to myself because I placed it on a high pedestal, somewhere above me, so I could not relate it to myself. But isn't art made for an audience to connect to?

		<p> I also never noticed how much music influenced the way I thought of paintings. Music is so subtle but makes such a difference in how we perceive art. I read webtoons online and some of them have original music to go with it. It has substantial impact on how I am feeling and how it impacts my perception of the plot, characters and their motives.

		<p> Additionally, whenever we see paintings it is never in the way of the original because it is a different size, and may not be soundless and still. It made me recall when I saw the Starry Night in person. It was a crowded Sunday at the MoMA and there was a humongous crowd dying to just catch a glimpse it. Besides the texture and the light falling on it that looked magical, it looked just like what I had seen in all of those reproductions through my life. Besides the mystification due to the fact that it was the original and the sheer value of it, I remember that I was simply overwhelmed by the crowd fighting to catch a glimpse that I had just left. It was amazing but was it amazing because I personally found it amazing or because I was told by society of its value and told to find it amazing?
